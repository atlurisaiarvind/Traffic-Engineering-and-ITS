# Traffic-Engineering-and-ITS
# Optimized Traffic Signalization System
* Objective: - Design signal settings of intersections on a real road artery based on computations of impacts of the project with respect to current conditions
* Role: - Identified critical levels and improved overall delays of intersections; synchronised developed metrics for computation of ideal traffic conditions
